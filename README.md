Collection of scripts to allow maintaining patches to [UFO 50](https://50games.fun/) (and maybe other GMS games)

`.csx` files are meant to be run within a compatible [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool) version, either a build from the [underanalyzer](https://github.com/UnderminersTeam/UndertaleModTool/tree/underanalyzer) branch or from this [fork](https://github.com/p-sam/UndertaleModTool)

`.au3` files are optional [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) scripts to aid development of patches and/or game editing

For more info, check each script header for more explanation on what they do
